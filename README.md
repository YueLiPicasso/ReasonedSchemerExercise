# Exercise Code I wrote while reading _The Reasoned Schemer 2nd (trs2)_

[trs2impl](trs2impl): implementation of miniKanren by authors of trs2.

[exercise.rkt](exercise.rkt): my reproduction of the example programs in trs2 uptil the bit arithmetics chapters.

[bit-arith.rkt](bit-arith.rkt) : my reproduction of the example programs in the bit arithmetics chapters. 
Division (by spliting the numbers) is not fully undetstood and logarithmic is skipped.

[trit-arith.rkt](trit-arith.rkt): an exercise that I set for myself where I define addition for trinary numbers.  

[unify.rkt](unify.rkt): my reproduction of the miniKanren implementation. Alternative versions of the functions _walk_ and _ifte_ are explored
for the purpose of helping me to understand them.

[named-let.rkt](named-let.rkt): an exercise where I resolve a 
[named-let](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/mit-scheme-ref/Iteration.html) 
structure into a recursive function definition followed by
a call of this function. Named let is first used in the book for the _ifte_ function.
